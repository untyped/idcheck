Introduction
============

IDCheck is an open source authentication system.  It is
available from http://idcheck.sourceforge.net/

This software provides a client to IDCheck that allows
servlets to authenticate users via an IDCheck server, and
query an in-memory database (aka hash-table) of user
information stored by IDCheck.

There is an example servlet in the file example-servlet.ss.
To run this example, edit test-configuration.ss to configure
the IDCheck library for your test environment, then run the
run-example-servlet.ss script:

    mzscheme -mtv run-example-servlet.ss

IDCheck API
===========

Types
-----

> exn:idcheck

Exception thrown when the IDCheck library encounters an
error.  A subclass for exn, it declares no additional
fields.  Use exn:idcheck? to check type.

Parameters
----------

> idcheck-url : (parameter string)

The URL of the IDCheck CGI we communicate with.

Example: "http://idcheck.untyped.com/idcheck"
  
> idcheck-redirect-url : (parameter string)

The URL we redirect people to so they can log in to IDCheck.
This will normally be the same as idcheck-url, but may be
different (for example, it may be https instead of http).

Example: "https://idcheck.untyped.com/idcheck"

> base-url : (parameter string)

The base URL, *without a trailing slash*, of the server
running this IDCheck client.

Example: "http://www.untyped.com"
  
> idcheck-cookie-domain : (parameter string)

The "domain" attribute set on IDCheck cookies. It must be
a partial domain name, starting with a full stop. For example:

     ".untyped.com"

The parameter must be set to a common suffix of the domain name
of the local web server and the IDCheck server. For example:

    IDCheck server:    "idcheck.untyped.com"
    Web server:        "www.untyped.com"
    Parameter setting: ".untyped.com"

The parameter must be set before the main library functions 
can be used.


Functions
---------

> (with-idcheck-authenticated-login request controller)
with-idcheck-authenticated-login : request (request -> 'a) -> 'a

This function accepts two arguments: a request (see the web
server documentation) and a controller.  It ensures the user
is authenticated by IDCheck (possibly generated several web
requests) before passing control to the controller.

> (get-key request)
get-key : request -> (U string #f)

Get and validate the IDCheck key associated with this
request, or #f if no key exists

> (idcheck-login request)
idcheck-login : request -> request

Login the user via IDCheck if they have not already been
logged in.  Stores the user information returned by IDCheck
in the database.

> (idcheck-logout request)
idcheck-logout : request -> request

Removes the user information from the database, and clears
the cookie containing the key.  

Note that this function does *not* logout the user from
IDCheck.  Logging out a user from IDCheck is problematic, as
their single IDCheck login can be shared between multiple
applications.  So this function clears *our* record of their
login, but not IDCheck's record.

> (lookup-user key)
lookup-user : string -> (U string #f)

Gets the user information from the database, or #f if no
information exists.

> (remove-user! key)
remove-user! : string -> void

Removes the user from the database
